## Welcome! 👋

I'm Ignacio, a freelance software developer based in Montevideo, Uruguay (UTC-3).

I love building complex systems that work by themselves.
Lately, I've been leaning towards a more administrative/managerial part of software development, architecting scalable systems and doing project management while assuring that the quality of the end product is excellent.

Other than software, I love music, sports, and traveling. I find history and culture fascinating.
